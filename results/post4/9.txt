A class may be declared with one or more modifiers which affect its runtime behavior: Access modifiers: public, protected, and private Modifier requiring override: abstract Modifier restricting to one instance: static Modifier prohibiting value modification: final Modifier forcing strict floating point behavior: strictfp Annotations Not all modifiers are allowed on all classes, for example an interface cannot be final and an enum cannot be abstract. java.lang.reflect.Modifier contains declarations for all possible modifiers. It also contains methods which may be used to decode the set of modifiers returned by Class.getModifiers(). The ClassDeclarationSpy example shows how to obtain the declaration components of a class including the modifiers, generic type parameters, implemented interfaces, and the inheritance path.
